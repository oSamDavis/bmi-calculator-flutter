# BMI Calculator 💪

## Goal

The objective of this project is to look at how I can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our beautiful user interface designs. 


## What I will create

A Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
